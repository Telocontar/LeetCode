# LeetCode

Repository containing solutions to some [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems. Problems are assigned to four different topics: 
* [algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms)
* [concurrency](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database)
* [database](https://leetcode.com/problemset/shell)
* [shell](https://leetcode.com/problemset/concurrency)

This repository mimics the structure described above. Additionally it holds a few utility scripts and a [webscraper script](https://github.com/Telocontar/leet_code/blob/master/helper_script.py) for automatically generating the test cases based on the problem definition.
